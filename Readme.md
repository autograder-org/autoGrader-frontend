# Automated Assignment Grading System with AI Model Evaluation

**Objective:**
- Develop an automated assignment grading system to reduce manual grading fatigue and improve efficiency.
- Evaluate the reliability of various AI models in grading assignments as part of a research initiative.

**Project Steps:**

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Establish a project timeline and milestones.
   - Identify the necessary technological stack and resources, including RAG, LangChain, and LLM models.

2. **Data Input Module:**
   - Develop an input module that accepts a zip file containing text-based assignments (Word, PDF, Python notebooks).
   - Design a mechanism to extract and process text from these formats for grading.

3. **Grading Criteria Definition:**
   - Implement a system allowing graders to define specific grading criteria and processes for each assignment type.
   - Ensure the system supports diverse grading metrics and workflows tailored to different assignments.

4. **AI Grading System:**
   - Integrate AI automation flows to grade assignments based on the predefined criteria.
   - Employ multiple AI models and compare their grading outputs to ensure reliability and consistency.

5. **Grading Consistency and Verification:**
   - Define a protocol for grading each assignment multiple times to verify consistency.
   - Develop an algorithm to compare grading outcomes across iterations, flagging significant discrepancies for review.

6. **Flagging System:**
   - Create a web interface to display flagged assignments, highlighting variations in grading.
   - Allow graders to review and adjust grades for flagged assignments, ensuring accuracy.

7. **Result Compilation and Reporting:**
   - Generate comprehensive reports detailing each assignment's grade, confidence levels, and variation across grading iterations.
   - Include constructive feedback based on grading metrics, offering insights into areas of improvement for students.

8. **Testing and Iteration:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of the system with a variety of assignment samples.
   - Gather feedback from potential users and refine the system based on this input.

9. **Future Expansion:**
   - Plan for the incorporation of more complex assignment types, including those with embedded images or code, in subsequent phases of the project.

10. **Documentation and Dissemination:**
    - Document the development process, system architecture, and user instructions.
    - Prepare a paper or presentation to share the research findings on AI model reliability in grading.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- An operational automated grading system that enhances grading efficiency and consistency.
- Insights into the effectiveness and reliability of different AI models in the educational grading context.
